# Sowdoku — UI Overhaul & Difficulty Plan

Living checklist. Check items off as they land; keep notes on decisions made
mid-implementation so the doc stays a true record, not just an aspiration.

---

## Part A — UI polish & layout

### A1. Layout: let the board own the screen — **done**
- [x] Converted `body` to a column app-shell filling `100dvh` (dropped the old
      centered `.frame` card entirely — header/status-strip/board-area/
      below-board/action-bar are now direct flex children)
- [x] Board sizes itself off the tighter viewport axis via `container-type:
      size` on `.board-area` + `width: min(100cqw, 100cqh); aspect-ratio: 1`
      on `.board-wrap` — no JS resize logic needed
- [x] Slim header (wordmark + hearts + ⚙), status strip above board, docked
      action bar below
- [x] Mobile: board goes near-full-bleed (tighter padding under a
      `max-width: 480px` query), action bar docked at the bottom (thumb
      reach is automatic — it's the last flex child, pinned to the viewport
      bottom by the column layout)
- [x] Tagline dropped (rules are already taught by the hint line + create-
      sheet mode notes); the rotating saying **relocated** rather than
      deleted — it now appears on the win veil (`#veilSaying`, freshly picked
      each solve via `pickSaying()`) instead of a persistent footer eating
      board space on every screen
- [x] Board top-aligned, not centered, within `.board-area` — on a narrow-tall
      viewport the board is width-bound and can't fill the height; centering
      it left an unexplained-looking gap above *and* below, top-aligning
      pushes all the leftover space below the board where it reads as
      intentional, not like the board is "floating"

### A2. Controls: group by frequency — **done**
- [x] Header: wordmark · hearts · ⚙ settings (settings button + popover live
      in a `.settings-wrap`, menu now opens *downward* anchored under the
      button instead of upward from a bottom toolbar)
- [x] Status strip: mode · size · difficulty · 🌱 code · "N left" — unchanged
      content, just relocated above the board as its own row
- [x] Action bar: ↶ undo · 👁 peek · ⌫ clear ‖ ＋ new field · 🕘 history,
      docked to the bottom, icon-over-label `.actbtn`s
- [x] Peek graduated from the ⚙ menu to the action bar
- [x] `.actbtn` sized `min-width: 3.4rem; min-height: 2.9rem` (both axes
      clear 44px at the default font scale)
- [x] "＋ create" and "new field" merged into one action-bar button (opens
      the create sheet); the old instant-reroll shortcut moved *into* the
      sheet as a new "🎲 surprise me" button (reroll the seed + tend
      immediately, one tap) — hidden for daily/ladder/gauntlet since their
      seed isn't player-chosen
- [x] Gentle two-tap confirm on "clear": first tap arms it (label flips to
      "sure?", a warm-red outline), a second tap within 2.2s (or clicking
      the confirm state) actually clears; anything else disarms it. No
      native `confirm()` dialog — matches the "gentle failure" brand
- [x] Keyboard shortcuts added: `H` peek, `N` opens the create sheet (⌘Z
      undo, `Esc` already worked and still does, now also disarms a pending
      clear-confirm)

**Bug caught during testing:** the clear-confirm's "click anywhere else
disarms it" listener compared `e.target !== clearBtnEl`, but the button's own
click handler replaced its `innerHTML` (to show "sure?"), which **destroyed
the exact child node the click had targeted** (e.g. the icon `<span>`) mid-
dispatch. By the time the event bubbled to `document`, `e.target` referenced
a now-detached node, so `clearBtnEl.contains(e.target)` came back `false` and
the listener immediately disarmed the very click that had just armed it —
the button silently never worked via a real click (only via a synthetic
`.click()` call, which is why it wasn't caught by casual testing). Fixed by
never touching `innerHTML`: the label lives in a persistent `<span
class="lbl">` that only has its `textContent` swapped, so no node is ever
destroyed and `.contains()` stays valid. Caught by a Playwright test that
asserted the board was *actually* empty after two clicks, not just that the
heart count looked right (which can pass by coincidence even when the
button is silently broken).

Verified end-to-end: full mode/difficulty regression pass, all prior
feature tests (stakes, gesture-cap, starve, crag, accolades, gauntlet,
size-10, persistence) re-run clean after the restructure, plus new checks
for the settings-menu position, clear-confirm arm/disarm/execute cycle,
surprise-me, and both keyboard shortcuts. Screenshots taken at desktop
(1000×800), a wide-tall viewport (900×1400 — confirmed the "empty space"
there is correct largest-square-in-container math, not a bug), and real
mobile portrait (390×844).

### A2b. Settings menu redesign — **done** (user-directed, follow-up to A2)
- [x] **"How to play" info sheet.** New `#infoBack` sheet (same pattern as
      create/history), opened from a dedicated `ℹ how to play` button at the
      top of the ⚙ menu. Five sections: The rules, Controls, Difficulty,
      Stakes, Assist — the persistent tap/long-press/drag hint line that used
      to sit permanently under the board is gone, its content expanded and
      moved here instead (freeing more board space, on top of A1's work).
- 2026-07-01 — **Follow-up bug: the grid fix wasn't the whole story.** User
  reported the right-hand column still cut off on their actual machine
  (Safari). All my verification of the earlier `gridTemplateRows` fix ran
  against Playwright's Chromium, which never reproduced it. Installed
  Playwright's WebKit engine (Safari's actual rendering engine) and confirmed:
  `.board-wrap` — `width: min(100cqw, 100cqh); aspect-ratio: 1;` inside a
  `container-type: size` ancestor — rendered as 1364.73×1379.52px in WebKit,
  not square, a ~1% drift invisible at some sizes/viewports but visibly
  clipping the last row/column at others (matches "sometimes fine, sometimes
  cut off" being size/viewport-dependent). This is a genuine WebKit quirk in
  combining `aspect-ratio` with container-query-derived sizing, not something
  the earlier `gridTemplateRows` fix could touch (that fixed a different,
  real bug — rows not matching an already-square container — but the
  container itself wasn't reliably square to begin with in WebKit).
  Replaced the CSS-only approach with a `sizeBoardWrap()` JS function
  (`.board-area.clientWidth/Height` minus its own padding, `Math.floor` of
  the smaller axis, set as explicit `px` width/height on `.board-wrap`) plus
  a `ResizeObserver` on `.board-area` so it stays correct across any layout
  change (viewport resize, launcher font-scale change, etc.) without
  depending on any CSS engine's aspect-ratio/container-query implementation.
  Dropped `container-type: size` and the `aspect-ratio`/`min(cqw,cqh)` width
  from the CSS entirely — verified in WebKit that `.board-wrap` is now
  pixel-identical square (e.g. 1364×1364) with 0px cell-size spread at every
  board size 6–10, confirmed the `ResizeObserver` correctly keeps it square
  across a live viewport resize, and re-ran the full Chromium regression
  suite clean. Lesson: this repo's target is Safari (visible in every
  screenshot the user's sent), so layout-affecting CSS changes should get at
  least a WebKit-engine spot-check going forward, not just Chromium.
- [x] **Slow mode folded into the stakes spectrum.** Was a separate boolean
      (`game.slow`) next to the 3-tier `stakes` control; now `stakes` is one
      4-tier spectrum (`slow → gentle → honest → stern`, `STAKES_RANK`
      0–3). `isSlow()` (= `game.stakes === "slow"`) replaces every prior
      `game.slow` check. Selecting "slow" refills hearts to a clean slate
      (mirroring the old toggle-on behavior); `stakesAtLeast()` needed no
      change since slow's rank (0) is below every real check. One-time
      migration in `restore()`: an old persisted `s.slow: true` maps to
      `stakes: "slow"` (mode-forced stakes, e.g. Wallow's "stern", still
      wins over the migration).
- [x] **Assist simplified from 3 modes to 2.** Dropped "auto" (always-on,
      "not helpful" per the user — it never stepped back for harder bands)
      and kept the smarter "gated" behavior, renamed to "on" (shades through
      Sunbeam/Meadow, off by Hilltop/Crag); "manual" renamed "off". One-time
      migration in `loadAssist()`: old `"manual"` → `"off"`, old `"auto"`/
      `"gated"` → `"on"`. Wallow's forced assist updated from `"manual"` to
      `"off"`; the `accoladesFor()`/`playScore()` "unaided" check updated
      from `rec.assist === "manual"` to `"off"`.
- [x] Fixed a nested-scroll visual bug caught while screenshotting the new
      info sheet: `.info-body` had its own `max-height`+`overflow:auto`
      inside `.sheet`'s existing scroll region, crowding the close button
      against the last line of text. Removed the inner scroll — the outer
      `.sheet` already scrolls long content (same pattern the history list
      already used), so there's no reason for two nested regions.
      Verified visually before and after.

Verified end-to-end: info sheet opens from the menu (and auto-closes the
menu), all 5 sections present, closes via button/backdrop/Escape; persistent
hint line confirmed gone from the main screen; stakes segmented control
shows exactly `[slow, gentle, honest, stern]`; assist shows exactly
`[on, off]`; selecting "slow" hides the hearts row and a real mistake
(forced via assist off so it isn't silently absorbed) neither docks a heart
nor locks the field. Full prior regression suite (stakes, gesture-cap,
starve, crag, accolades, streak, gauntlet, size-10, grid-uniformity,
persistence, keyboard shortcuts, create-sheet) re-run clean after the
merge — this session touched a lot of shared state (`game.slow` had 12+
call sites), so re-running everything wasn't optional.

### A3. Win / fail results screen — **done**
- [x] Shared results-card component: the existing veil `.card` gained a
      `#vStats` row, `#vVerdict` line, and `#vPreview` block, all populated
      by mode-agnostic helpers (`renderWinStats`, `renderFailStats`,
      `showResultPreview`) called from every win/fail branch — not a
      separate component, but genuinely shared logic across all of them.
- [x] Win: stats row — time to settle, slips, peeks (when any), score, and
      a `new high score!` pill when `finalizeGame()` just beat the stored
      best (best score shown either way via the existing `bestScore()`).
- [x] Win: difficulty verdict — compares `rec.eScore` (played) against
      `rec.aScore` (looks-like); only shown when they diverge by ≥14 points,
      matching the "not every solve needs a comment" spirit of the accolades
      work — most solves show no verdict line at all, and that's correct.
- [x] Win: next-field preview — mini board, code, band, and effort bar for
      *exactly* the field the primary button starts next. This was the
      trickiest part: `startAmble`/`startLadder`/`startGauntlet`/
      `nextGauntletField` all previously called `randomSeed()` internally,
      so a naive preview would show one field and tap through to a
      different one. Gave each an optional trailing `seed` param; the veil
      now locks in `randomSeed()` *once* per render, previews that exact
      seed, and passes the same seed to the button's handler. Campaign
      previews needed no locking — curated fields already have a fixed
      seed. Verified as an explicit WYSIWYG assertion in every mode tested
      (amble, ladder): preview code === the code of the field you actually
      land on, not just "a similar one."
- [x] Fail: progress (`placed N/M`), slips, time-so-far — reads live game
      state (`flushTick()` first so playMs is current), no score-penalty
      language, matches the existing "no harm done" copy.
- [x] Fail: "show me where it went wrong" — hides the veil (board becomes
      visible again, still locked at 0 hearts) and marks every empty cell
      that *was* the solution's cell for its row with a faded ghost pig
      (`.cell.reveal`, 42% opacity + desaturated). `game.revealedSolution`
      gates this in both `render()`'s cell loop and `renderVeil()` (so the
      veil doesn't immediately re-cover the board on the next render), and
      resets on "fresh start" or "clear" — clear still refills hearts for
      non-slow/non-gauntlet modes exactly as before, so revealing then
      clearing is a full, honest do-over.
- [x] Shared fade/rise animation (`veilIn`, opacity+translateY, .32s) on the
      card; added to the existing `prefers-reduced-motion` block alongside
      the piggy-thud/bad-flash/starved-pulse rules it already disables.

Verified end-to-end: win stats text includes time/slips/score, new-high-score
badge appears on a fresh code's first solve, next-field preview shown and
its code is byte-for-byte identical to the field actually landed on after
tapping the primary button (checked for both a freeform amble win and a
ladder climb, including the climb chip advancing to the correct rung); fail
veil shows progress/slips/time and both action buttons; reveal correctly
marks 5 cells faded-pig on a 6×6 with one correct placement already down,
hides the veil, and both the reveal marks and full hearts return after a
clear. Screenshots confirm the visual design reads clean and matches the
create-sheet's existing preview language (deliberately reused, not
reinvented). Full prior regression suite (16 test files) re-run clean.

### A4. Asset & branding generation (separate image-gen track)
- [x] **Prompts written — done.** Now living in `ASSET_PROMPTS.md` (moved
      there from a session Artifact so they're durable/version-controlled,
      not tied to a session URL) — a reusable style preamble plus 15
      prompts grouped by category, each tagged with its target file path
      and either its exact call site in `index.html` or a suggested one
      where none exists yet. Palette and type throughout are pulled
      directly from the game's own CSS custom properties and font stacks —
      no new typefaces or colors invented.
- [x] Logo / wordmark — wired into the header title (`.title`), replacing
      the plain-text "Sowdoku 🐖"
- [x] Favicon / app icon (512/192/180/32/16 + `.ico`) — full `<link>` set
      + manifest added to `<head>` (there were none before)
- [x] Piggy sprite: settled — wired into `pigSVG()`
- [ ] Piggy sprite: unimpressed — not generated. Still needs a *new*
      transient state, not a pure swap (see Phase 3 note below)
- [ ] Piggy sprite: dozing — not generated, no call site
- [ ] Piggy sprite: celebrating — not generated, no call site
- [x] Hoofprint marker — wired in via a new `hoofprintHTML(r, c)` helper
      that positions two rotated hoofprint images per cell with a
      deterministic per-cell angle (reads as a little walking trail),
      replacing the old three-dot `<i>` markup
- [x] Hearts (full / empty) — wired into `heartSVG(filled)`
- [ ] Board paper texture — not generated, no call site
- [ ] Background farm-horizon border — not generated, no call site
- [x] Win vignette — wired into the win veil, between the title and the
      descriptive text
- [x] Fail vignette — wired into the fail veil, same slot
- [x] Empty-state spots — history + curated wired into the `.hempty`
      blocks in the history sheet; first-run generated but unwired (no
      first-run flow exists yet)
- [ ] OG / social share image — not generated, no call site
- [x] Misty Morning badge — wired into the `data-mode="fog"` button in the
      create sheet's mode picker

**Phased plan**, since half of these need a new UI decision and half are
pure swaps:

1. **Phase 1 — pure swaps + new-but-obvious. Done.** Favicon/manifest,
   logo, settled piggy, hearts, hoofprint.
2. **Phase 2 — win/fail vignettes + empty states + misty badge. Done**
   (except empty-firstrun, deferred — no UI hook yet).
3. **Phase 3 — the open-ended ones. Not started.**
   Unimpressed/dozing/celebrating piggy poses, paper texture, horizon
   border, OG image. These either need new code to trigger a new state
   (unimpressed/celebrating) or are pure ambiance calls with real risk of
   cluttering the "calm clarity" house style if overdone — worth a design
   gut-check per `STYLE.md` before committing, not just dropping in
   because the asset exists.

**How Phase 1/2 actually got built:** generated via Antigravity IDE (used
purely for image generation, at the user's preference — not for wiring
code, which I did directly). Two issues found and fixed during
integration, neither caused by the generation itself:
- **Fake-SVG format.** Every ".svg" the tool produced was actually a
  raster PNG wrapped in an SVG container (`<image
  href="data:image/png;base64,...">`) — no vector benefit, and base64 +
  XML overhead bloated `assets/` to 3.7MB for icon-scale art. Fixed by
  extracting the real PNG data, right-sizing each to its actual on-screen
  use (hearts were sourced at 380px for an 18px display!), and
  palette-quantizing (128 colors, `Pillow`) — 3.7MB → ~250KB with no
  visible quality loss. Saved as real `.png` files; `index.html` and
  `ASSET_PROMPTS.md` updated to match.
- **Pre-existing `[hidden]` CSS bug, caught by this review.** `.preview`
  (used by both the create sheet's field preview and the veil's
  `#vPreview`) sets `display: flex` explicitly. A class selector and the
  browser's default `[hidden] { display: none }` have equal CSS
  specificity, so on a tie the later (author) rule wins — meaning
  `hideResultPreview()` was correctly setting `hidden`, but the fail veil
  kept showing a stray "next field" preview box anyway. This dates back
  to the original A3 work (reusing `.preview` for `#vPreview`), not to
  the asset pass — just never visually caught until this review looked
  closely at the fail veil screenshot. Fixed with `.preview[hidden] {
  display: none; }`, matching the pattern already used correctly
  everywhere else in the file (`.climbchip`, `.stuck`, `.menu`,
  `.sheet-backdrop`, `.orow`, `.campaign` all already had this).
  `.vvignette[hidden]` given the same treatment defensively.

### A5. Other polish backlog
- [ ] Sound: wooden thud / pen-complete chime / solve snuffle (off by default)
- [ ] Real typography: Fraunces (headers) + Inter (UI)
- [ ] Illegal-placement teaching: highlight *why* a slip failed
- [ ] Pen-completion shimmer
- [ ] First-run onboarding (tap / long-press / Wallow Rule, `seenIntro` flag)
- [ ] Colorblind support: optional per-pen letter/pattern overlay
- [ ] Keyboard/board accessibility: arrow-key focus, Enter/Space, aria-labels
- [ ] PWA: manifest.json + icon set + minimal service worker
- [ ] Render diffing instead of full `board.innerHTML` rebuild per paint
- [ ] Share affordance on win screen (code + one-line challenge)
- [ ] Quiet "today's field awaits 🌱" chip when daily untouched
- [ ] Hearts near the board (mobile) so cause/effect (bad tap → heart) is close

---

## Part B — Difficulty & gameplay depth

### B1. Stakes setting (heart strictness) — **done**
Player-facing tiers, persisted like `assist`:
- **gentle** (current behavior) — heart only for a placement that breaks a
  rule against pigs already on the board
- **honest** — + heart for a legal-but-wrong pig (doesn't match the solution)
  · + heart for starving a pen (including via your own hoofprints)
- **stern** — + heart for a hoofprint placed on a cell that is actually the
  solution cell for its row

Implementation notes:
- [x] `STAKES_MODES`, `loadStakes()`/`saveStakes()` mirroring assist
- [x] `game.stakes` / `game.lockedStakes` in `beginGame()` and `restore()`
- [x] Wallow mode forces `stakes: "stern"` (pairs with its existing 1 heart +
      manual assist — finally makes the single heart mean something)
- [x] ⚙ menu: new "stakes" row, segmented gentle/honest/stern, unlockable by
      user tap same as assist
- [x] `placePiggy`: legal-but-wrong-vs-solution docks a heart at honest+
- [x] Hoofprint set: wrong-vs-solution docks a heart at stern (checked at set
      time, not on every render); the mark is rejected outright, not left on
      the board
- [x] Starved-by-fences check (`starvedByFences`): pen with no pig and no
      legal, non-hoofprinted cell remaining docks a heart at honest+; also
      surfaced in `render()` (the `.starved` blush + stuck note) even with
      assist off, so the dock is never a mystery
- [x] **Cap: at most one strict-mode heart dock per pointer gesture** — a
      shared `gestureDocked` flag reset in the `pointerdown` handler and the
      `contextmenu` handler (right-click isn't backed by pointerdown)
- [x] Toast feedback per violation type ("not quite this piggy's patch" ·
      "that patch was the piggy's own" · "that fences a whole pen out")
- [x] Recorded onto history (`buildRecord.stakes`) so past runs remember
      which strictness they were played at
- [x] README updated with a "Stakes" section and the Wallow description
- [x] Verified end-to-end with Playwright (honest wrong-placement dock,
      stern wrong-hoofprint dock, honest fence-starve dock on both a
      1-cell and a 13-cell region with no premature docking, one-dock-
      per-gesture cap under a multi-cell drag, Wallow's auto-lock, and
      persistence across reload)

### B2. Difficulty & engagement mechanics (ranked by effort)
- [x] **A. Unlock the fourth solver band ("crag") — done.** Added a genuine
      L4 technique (`propagateL123`/`level4`: hypothesize a candidate,
      propagate at up to L3, eliminate on contradiction — the one-deeper
      mirror of L3). In practice the region generator rarely produces a
      puzzle that strictly *needs* L4, so `crag` is band-split from `hilltop`
      by grind (`l3 >= 2` separate contradiction chains), with genuine L4-only
      solves also folding into `crag`. `generate()` gives `crag` requests a
      bigger attempt budget (6000 vs 2000) since it's rarer; benchmarked at
      0 failures / <35ms across 15 seeds × 4 sizes. Wired through: `BANDS`,
      `BAND_CHAR`/`CHAR_BAND` (+`c`), board-code regex, `DIFF_MUL`,
      `humanScore` base, the create-sheet difficulty picker, `assistOn()`'s
      gated threshold (off for hilltop *and* crag), the Ladder (now tops out
      at 9×9 crag), and Wallow (now requests crag instead of hilltop).
      Verified end-to-end with Playwright: crag selectable + previews
      correctly, board code round-trips (`8c-...`), Wallow auto-locks to
      crag+stern+manual+1 heart, gated assist confirmed off on a crag field.
- [x] **B. Bigger fields — 10×10 done, 11×11 deliberately not shipped.**
      Benchmarked both before touching UI, per the plan's own caveat. 10×10:
      0-1/15 failures across bands at `maxAttempts=12000` (scaled by size in
      `generate()`), worst case ~900ms (meadow), everything else under
      200ms — acceptable for a "tend this field" click. 11×11: real
      reliability problems even at 8000 attempts (meadow/hilltop failed
      5-6/8 times — i.e. silently handed back the wrong requested
      difficulty) and worst-case over 1.5s even when it succeeded. Shipping
      11×11 as-is would mean the difficulty picker quietly lies about a third
      of the time, so it's cut from this pass — needs generator work (smarter
      region growth or a non-restart search), not just a bigger attempt
      budget. Also fixed a latent bug the size bump exposed: `PALETTE` only
      had 9 colors, so a 10th region would have silently reused region 0's
      color (`id % PALETTE.length` wrapping) — added a 10th pastel. Verified
      end-to-end: 10×10 selectable in the create sheet, 100 cells render,
      10 distinct region ids map to 10 distinct rendered colors (no
      collision), board code round-trips (`10m-...`).
- [ ] **C. Twin litters** ("Two to a Pen") — generalize solution generator,
      uniqueness counter, and solver from exactly-one to exactly-k per
      row/column/pen; own milestone, needs ≥9×9
- [ ] **D. Mud puddles** — pre-blocked cells no pig may occupy; lets the
      generator reach knottier unique layouts; on-brand art opportunity
- [ ] **E. Limited hoofprints** — scratch marks become a capped resource
      (e.g. `2 × size` per field)
- [ ] **F. Settled means settled** — mode where lifting a placed pig costs a
      heart or isn't allowed
- [x] **G. The Gauntlet — done.** New `gauntlet` mode: a fixed 3-stage
      escalation (`GAUNTLET` array, 7×7 meadow → 8×8 hilltop → 9×9 crag),
      `beginGame()` extended with `opts.carryHearts`/`carryMaxHearts` so
      `nextGauntletField()` hands the *remaining* heart count forward
      instead of each field starting fresh. Two interactions needed explicit
      protection once hearts became a cross-field resource: (1) the "clear"
      button previously refilled hearts unconditionally on every mode —
      special-cased to skip that for gauntlet, or a player could clear their
      way back to full hearts mid-run; (2) running out of hearts needed its
      own veil branch ("the gauntlet ends here") distinct from the generic
      per-field "fresh start" failure, since the whole run ends, not just the
      field. `stats.gauntletsCleared` increments only when the *last* stage
      solves, surfaced quietly in the history header. Wired through the
      create sheet (mode button, fixed size/diff, hidden size/diff/seed
      rows), the climb chip ("field N/3"), persist/restore, and buildRecord.
      Verified end-to-end: hearts carry correctly across fields (not reset),
      clear does NOT refill the shared pool, depleting it mid-run shows the
      gauntlet-specific fail veil at the correct field, screenshots confirm
      the UI reads correctly at each state.
- [x] **H. Par & quiet accolades — done.** `accoladesFor(rec)` returns
      **tidy** (0 hoofprints) and **unaided** (0 hints, manual assist);
      "clean" (0 slips) isn't a separate tag since it already shows as
      "0 slips" in the outcome line — added it anyway and it was pure
      redundant noise, so it was dropped. Both accolades nudge `playScore`
      (+40 tidy, +60 unaided, same multiplier chain as the existing
      penalties). `stats.cleanStreak`/`bestCleanStreak` track consecutive
      zero-slip solves in `finalizeGame`; any mistake or an unsolved/
      abandoned field resets the streak to 0. Surfaced in the history
      header only once `cleanStreak >= 2` ("3 clean in a row") — kept
      quiet, no per-solve toast/badge treatment. Verified end-to-end:
      two clean 6×6 solves show `tidy`/`unaided` on both cards and
      "2 clean in a row"; a genuine mistake (forced via manual assist so
      it isn't silently absorbed by gated auto-shading) correctly drops
      the streak line entirely.
- [ ] **I. Daily modifier rotation** — fog Wed / stern Fri / gauntlet Sun, etc.

**Recommended build order:** B1 stakes → A (crag band) → H (par/accolades,
rewards the new difficulty) → G (gauntlet) → B (bigger boards) → D (mud
puddles) → C (twin litters, own milestone).

## Status log
- 2026-07-01 — Plan captured from design discussion. Starting implementation
  with B1 (stakes setting).
- 2026-07-01 — B1 (stakes setting) implemented and verified end-to-end in a
  headless browser.
- 2026-07-01 — B2-A (fourth solver band, "crag") implemented and verified.
- 2026-07-01 — B2-H (par & quiet accolades) implemented and verified. Asked
  the user which track to prioritize next (more mechanics vs. the Part A UI
  overhaul); no response, proceeding down the recommended mechanics order.
- 2026-07-01 — B2-G (the Gauntlet) implemented and verified.
- 2026-07-01 — B2-B (bigger fields) implemented for 10×10; 11×11 benchmarked
  and deliberately cut for this pass (see notes above — real reliability
  problems, not just slowness). Five of six B2 mechanics items now done (A,
  B, G, H, plus B1 from Part B1). Remaining: D (mud puddles), C (twin
  litters — own milestone), I (daily modifier rotation), F (settled means
  settled). This is a natural stopping point — the remaining items are
  larger (C is its own milestone) or lower-value (I, F) relative to what's
  shipped. Pausing here to let the user review before continuing further,
  since a large amount of unreviewed work has accumulated.
- 2026-07-01 — User asked "what is next?"; recommended and got confirmation
  to do Part A1/A2 (layout shell + control regrouping) next, since the new
  gameplay depth was sitting behind the exact cramped, scattered UI that
  motivated this whole plan. Implemented and verified — see A1/A2 notes
  above, including a real bug caught by testing (the clear-confirm button's
  outside-click listener silently broke itself via an `innerHTML`/
  `e.target` interaction). Remaining from Part A: A3 (win/fail results
  screen), A4 (asset generation — separate image-gen track), A5 (polish
  backlog). Natural next step is A3, since it directly showcases the
  accolades/streak/Crag work from Part B that has no dedicated results UI
  yet.
- 2026-07-01 — User reported the board looking cut off (screenshot: last row
  and last column of a 10×10 field visibly narrower than the rest) and asked
  to simplify the board's border. Root cause: `render()` only ever set
  `board.style.gridTemplateColumns`, never `gridTemplateRows` — rows fell
  back to `grid-auto-rows: auto`, sized off each `.cell`'s `aspect-ratio:1`
  (itself derived from the resolved *column* width). That auto-derived row
  height doesn't necessarily equal `.board`'s actual height, which A1's
  layout now forces to be an exact square via `.board-wrap`'s
  `aspect-ratio:1` + `min(100cqw,100cqh)` — before A1 the board's height was
  unconstrained and simply grew to match, so the mismatch was invisible.
  The error compounds with more rows, which is why it only became visible
  at 10×10 (new this session) and not at the smaller sizes shipped earlier.
  Fixed by setting `gridTemplateRows` explicitly alongside
  `gridTemplateColumns` — mirrors what `renderMini()` (the create-sheet
  preview) already did correctly. Verified with a Playwright check that
  measures every cell's actual bounding box: 0px width/height spread across
  all cells at every size 6–10 (previously would have shown a spread at 10).
  Also simplified `.board-wrap`'s frame per the request: padding
  1.1rem → .4rem, border-radius 1.4rem → .9rem, dropped the dual inset+drop
  box-shadow for one subtle shadow — the grid now reads as the whole board
  instead of a puzzle sitting inside a padded panel. Full regression suite
  re-run clean.
- 2026-07-01 — User asked for three changes to the settings menu at once: (1)
  move the persistent tap/long-press/drag hint text into a fuller "how to
  play" info screen reachable from the ⚙ menu, (2) fold "slow mode" into the
  stakes spectrum instead of a separate toggle, (3) simplify assist from
  3 modes to a plain on/off, dropping "auto" specifically as not helpful.
  All three implemented together as A2b (see above) since they're all
  reshaping the same settings menu. README updated to match (Assist section
  rewritten for the binary, Stakes section gained the "slow" tier and
  absorbed the old standalone "Slow Mode" bullet from the Modes list, peek's
  location corrected from "⚙ menu" to "docked action bar" — a stale leftover
  from A1/A2's move that hadn't been caught until reading the file closely
  for this edit).
- 2026-07-02 — A3 (win/fail results screen) implemented and verified — see
  notes above. This closes out everything from the original UI-overhaul ask
  except A4 (asset generation — a separate, user-driven image-gen track) and
  A5 (the polish backlog). Remaining across the whole plan: A4, A5, and from
  Part B2 — twin litters (its own milestone), mud puddles, limited
  hoofprints, "settled means settled", daily modifier rotation.
- 2026-07-02 — User reported assist "doesn't work anymore when turned on."
  Root cause: the on/off redesign (last session) kept the *old* "gated"
  behavior baked into "on" — shading was silently forced off past Meadow
  regardless of the toggle, so "on" looked broken on Hilltop/Crag. Confirmed
  live (0 shaded cells on Crag with assist "on"). Asked the user to confirm
  which difficulty, since the fix differs (design change vs. bug). Their
  answer reframed the whole feature: since assist genuinely can't be changed
  mid-game in any way that matters (the difficulty-gating meant toggling it
  live often did nothing), it shouldn't live in the always-visible ⚙ menu
  implying it always works — it belongs in the create sheet instead, decided
  once per field like size/difficulty. Implemented: (1) dropped the
  difficulty-gating from `assistOn()` entirely — "on" is now unconditional,
  any band; (2) moved the assist control from the ⚙ menu into the create
  sheet as a new `cAssistRow`, hidden for Wallow (forced off) same as the
  size/difficulty rows already hide for modes that don't use them; (3)
  `beginGame()` now takes an explicit `opts.assist` and auto-saves it as the
  new default preference *unless* it came from a mode-forced override — so
  Wallow's forced "off" doesn't quietly contaminate what the next amble
  field defaults to; (4) `openCreate()` simplified to just read
  `loadAssist()` directly, since `beginGame()` now keeps that preference
  current on its own. `buildRecord()` simplified too (`assist: game.assist`
  — no more "locked vs. live preference" branching, since there's no live
  toggle left to diverge from). Verified end-to-end: the exact repro from
  the bug report (Crag + assist on) now shades correctly; the settings menu
  no longer has an assist row; the create sheet's assist row is hidden for
  Wallow and shows for amble/misty; a Wallow round doesn't contaminate the
  next amble create's default. This broke assist-dependent preconditions in
  five other scratch tests (they toggled assist live, mid-game, which no
  longer does anything) — fixed by setting the precondition via localStorage
  *before* the field that needs it is created, and retired two tests
  (`test-crag-gated.js`, `test-crag.js`) that asserted the old, now-
  intentionally-removed gating behavior. Full 16-file regression suite green.
- 2026-07-02 — User: the win/fail veil was too transparent to read easily,
  and asked for a click-outside-to-dismiss / click-anywhere-to-restore
  interaction. Fixed both: (1) `.veil .card` now has its own opaque
  `var(--panel)` background, border, padding, and shadow — previously the
  card was just text floating directly on the translucent backdrop, so
  legibility depended entirely on the backdrop's opacity. Darkened the
  backdrop itself too (light cream → dark warm gray at low opacity), since a
  light backdrop behind a light opaque card gave almost no visual
  separation — the card needed to visibly read as a *frame*, not blend in.
  (2) Added a peek/restore interaction: a bubble-phase listener on `#veil`
  checks whether a click landed outside `.card` and, if so, hides the veil
  (a `.peeking` class with higher specificity than `.show`, so it wins even
  if `renderVeil()` re-adds "show" later) — then a capture-phase listener on
  `document` intercepts the *next* click anywhere, restores the veil, and
  stops that click from also doing whatever it would normally do (safe here
  since the game is always `locked()` while the veil is showing anyway, so
  nothing real is lost by swallowing the click). `renderVeil()` resets the
  peeking flag on every fresh call, so a new result never inherits a stale
  dismissed state. Verified: card has a solid background, clicking the
  backdrop dismisses (verified via computed `display`, not just class
  presence), clicking anywhere afterward restores it without placing a
  stray piggy, clicking inside the card never dismisses, and the veil's own
  buttons still work normally throughout. Full regression suite green (one
  spurious timeout on a background batch run turned out to be Chromium
  resource contention, not a real failure — confirmed by re-running that
  file alone).
- 2026-07-02 — A4 (asset/branding prompts) delivered as an Artifact — see
  notes above. Every code-driven item from the original UI-overhaul ask is
  now done (A1–A3, A2b). Remaining: A5 (polish backlog), the actual asset
  generation + integration pass once images come back, and Part B2's
  remaining mechanics (twin litters, mud puddles, limited hoofprints,
  "settled means settled", daily modifier rotation).
- 2026-07-02 — User doesn't have an image-gen API available to me here;
  decided to run the A4 asset pass through Antigravity IDE (Google's
  agentic coding tool) instead, driven manually since it doesn't expose a
  scriptable interface I could call directly (checked: its CLI,
  `antigravity-ide`, is a VS-Code-style file/window opener only, no
  image-gen flag). Moved the 15 prompts from the session Artifact into
  `ASSET_PROMPTS.md` for durability, and expanded A4's checklist above with
  the exact `index.html` call site (or lack of one) for every asset, plus a
  3-phase integration order (pure swaps → contained new UI decisions →
  open-ended/needs-a-design-call). Gave the user a ready-to-paste kickoff
  prompt for Antigravity pointing at both docs.
- 2026-07-02 — Antigravity generated Phase 1 + Phase 2 assets and wired
  Phase 1 into `index.html` on its own (auto-committed as "plan
  checkpoint" and "added assets" — a different workflow than mine, flagged
  to the user rather than assumed OK). I verified the result live before
  taking the user's "assets are in place" at face value: full regression
  suite passed after fixing a couple of my own tests' stale `.hearts svg`
  selectors (hearts are `<img>` now, not inline `<svg>` — not a real
  regression). Found and reported two real issues: every ".svg" was
  actually a raster PNG in disguise (3.7MB bloat), and Phase 2's assets
  were generated but never wired in. User confirmed: use Antigravity only
  for image generation going forward, asked me to fix the SVGs and wire in
  Phase 2 directly. Did both — see the A4 section above for the technical
  detail, including a pre-existing `[hidden]` CSS specificity bug caught
  along the way (fail veil was showing a stray next-field preview). Full
  regression suite + new Phase-2-specific tests all pass. Phase 3 remains:
  the piggy pose variants, texture, horizon border, and OG image, all of
  which need either new code (a transient "unimpressed" state) or a
  deliberate design gut-check before adding ambient art.
