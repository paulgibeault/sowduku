// The deploy artifact contains everything the app asks for at runtime — and
// nothing it shouldn't.
//
// IDENTICAL IN EVERY FLEET REPO. Do not edit one copy: change the canonical
// file and re-copy it (GAME_INTEGRATION §13a). It is a plain script rather
// than a node:test file on purpose — the fleet runs three different test
// runners, and every one of them can call this.
//
// It imports ./stage.mjs, which is the ONLY per-app part: static apps copy
// tracked files, bundled apps run their bundler, curated apps use their own
// file list. All of them export the same contract:
//
//   stage(outDir) -> { outDir }   // produce the deploy artifact in outDir
//   ROOT                          // repo root
//   PRECACHE_EXCLUDE              // optional; published but not precached
//
// Three lists have to agree and none of them check each other: index.html's
// tags, the service worker's precache list, and what the deploy publishes.
// Checking the repo instead of the artifact cannot catch a drift between
// them — every file is obviously present in a checkout. So stage for real
// and read what came out.
//
// Since stage() generates the precache list from the artifact
// (tools/inject-precache.mjs), the old direction of that check — "every
// precached file is published" — can no longer fail; it is now a property of
// how the list is built. The direction that CAN still fail is the reverse,
// and it is the one that actually strands players offline: a file the deploy
// publishes and the worker never caches. That is asserted below, with
// PRECACHE_EXCLUDE as the app's written-down list of deliberate omissions.
//
// Usage: node tools/verify-artifact.mjs [--keep <dir>]
